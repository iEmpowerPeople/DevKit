# DevKit

Shared AI configuration library - your single source of truth (SSOT) for custom tools like agents, skills, commands, MCPs etc.

Scripts sync with Claude Code and Opencode configs

## Model: Library vs Profiles vs Sync

**Library** = The complete catalogue of available tools  
**Profiles** = Your personal selections (which tools you want to use)  
**Sync** = The system that syncs your selected agents/skills/comannds to `~/.claude/` or `~/.config/opencode`

### Library Structure

```
DevKit-Claude/
├── library/
│   ├── shared/              # All users can create PRs and approve
│   │   ├── agents/
│   │   ├── skills/
│   │   ├── commands/
│   │   ├── mcp/
│   │   └── cli/
│   ├── xapids/              # xapids authors and owns PRs for this folder
│   │   ├── agents/
│   │   ├── skills/
│   │   └── commands/
│   └── tihany7/             # tihany7 authors and owns PRs for this folder
│       ├── agents/
│       ├── skills/
│       └── commands/
└── profiles/                # User selections (not auto-generated)
```

All team members have access to all configs - the folder structure indicates authorship and PR ownership.

### Profiles

Profiles contain your personal tool selections. They are automatically updated with all available tools from the library.

Example `profiles/xapids.yml`:
```yaml
agents:
  - id: shared-example-agent
    author: shared
    enabled: true
  - id: xapids-example-agent
    author: xapids
    enabled: false
```

Set `enabled: true` to sync a tool, `enabled: false` to skip it.

## Setup

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/iEmpowerPeople/DevKit-Claude.git
```

## How It Works

1. Add tools to `library/{author}/{category}/` folders
2. Run `./scripts/update-profile.sh xapids` to update your profile
3. Edit your profile to enable tools you want
4. GitHub Actions automatically keeps profiles and catalogue in sync

## Scripts

```bash
# Update your profile with all available tools (preserves enabled settings)
./scripts/update-profile.sh xapids

# Regenerate README catalogue
./scripts/gen-catalogue.sh
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Update your profile
./scripts/update-profile.sh xapids

# Edit to enable tools you want
vim profiles/xapids.yml
# Set enabled: true for tools you want
```

## Usage

Commit and push your changes for any of the files.

Create PR and merge for files you have PR/authour rights to.
<!-- AUTO-GENERATED CATALOGUE -->
