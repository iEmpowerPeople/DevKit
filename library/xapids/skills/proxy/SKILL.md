Use these workflows to research, configure, and run the LLM API Key Proxy. Invoke with `/proxy`.

## Workflows

- [`proxy-config.md`](./reference/proxy-config.md) - Pre-flight checks and research steps before changing proxy or client configuration.
- [`proxy-cc-env.md`](./reference/proxy-cc-env.md) - Manage Claude Code environment variables for proxy routing.
- [`proxy-online.md`](./reference/proxy-online.md) - Start the proxy server via Docker and verify it is running.
